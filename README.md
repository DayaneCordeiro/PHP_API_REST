</h4>

<div id="about">
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is a project that addresses an API in pure PHP in a simple way. The objective was to create a user control system that has a CRUD and a login method, and these functions can be accessed when the API is properly authenticated.</p>
</div>

<div id="pre-requirements">
    <h1>Pre requirements</h1>
üîπ To use the project it is necessary to have PHP and Apache installed on the computer considering that the system will run the system at localhost. For the development of this project, the XAMPP tool was used, which can be accessed at the following address: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html<br>
üîπ It is also necessary to have an API Client Platform. In this project Insomnia was used. This software can be found at the follow address: https://insomnia.rest/download<br>
üîπ You have to create the project database. You have to go to database folder, copy the sql code and paste in into the database manager of your choice (In this project SQLyog Communit software was used, you can find it in https://code.google.com/archive/p/sqlyog/wikis/Downloads.wiki). Press <b>CTRL + A</b> to select all SQL code and press to run. You will have two tables: user and log_change_user as the following images. <br><br>

![log_change_user_table](https://github.com/DayaneCordeiro/PHP_API_REST/blob/main/images/log_user_table.png)
</div>

<div id="how-to-use">
    <h1>How to use</h1>
üîπ The first step is to clone the project into the XAMPP htdocs folder, this is an example: <b>xampp/htdocs/PHP_API_REST/clone here</b>.<br>
üîπ To run the API it is necessary to have the Apache server and PHP connected.<br>
üîπ Go to the documentation/documents folder and open the index.html file in the browser of your choice. This file shows how to use each of the API endpoints. You can see a endpoint documentation example in the following image:<br><br>

![documentation_example](https://github.com/DayaneCordeiro/PHP_API_REST/blob/main/images/api_create_user.png)

üîπ Note that it is necessary to put the project path before the endpoint in the URL inside Insomnia. See the example:<br><br>

![request_example](https://github.com/DayaneCordeiro/PHP_API_REST/blob/main/images/request_example.png)


üîπ With the server and PHP working, you can use Insomnia to access the API functions, all the details are in the documentation mentioned in the previous topic.
